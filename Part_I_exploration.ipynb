    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Ford GoBike dataset contains anonymized trip data for the bike-sharing system from June 2017 to April 2019. <p style=\"color:red\"> **However, I decided to only use the data in the year 2018 (January 2018 to December 2018).**</p> The data includes information on individual bike rides such as trip duration, start and end time, start and end station, bike ID, and user type. Additionally, demographic data such as age, gender, and membership type is provided for some users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `duration_sec`: The duration of the bike ride in seconds\n",
    "- `start_time`: The date and time the bike ride started\n",
    "- `end_time`: The date and time the bike ride ended\n",
    "- `start_station_id`: The ID number of the station where the ride started\n",
    "- `start_station_name`: The name of the station where the ride started\n",
    "- `start_station_latitude`: The latitude of the station where the ride started\n",

    "- `end_station_longitude`: The longitude of the station where the ride ended\n",
    "- `bike_id`: The ID number of the bike used in the ride\n",
    "- `user_type`: The type of user, either \"Subscriber\" (members with monthly or annual memberships) or \"Customer\" (casual riders who - `purchase` a single ride or day pass)\n",

    "> 1. Based on the Ford GoBike dataset, I can explore when and where most trips are taken as the dataset includes information on the start time and location of each ride. This information can help me identify popular starting points and times for the bike-sharing system. I will start by analyzing the `start_station_name`. I will then use `start_station_latitude` and `start_station_longitude` columns to calculate the distance of travel. Doing so, I will be able to get a better understanding of when and where the most trips originate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. In addition to identifying popular starting points and times, I am also interested in exploring the characteristics of the riders such as age, sex, and user type. This can be done by analyzing the `member_birth_year`, `member_gender`, and `user_type` columns. Understanding the demographics of the riders can help me identify patterns in bike usage and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. I am also interested in exploring the time of the day, that is either **morning**, **afternoon**, **evening** or **night**.  Understanding the time of the day can help me identify patterns in bike usage and preferences. Moreover, I want to explore the day of the week and month of the year. Understanding the day of the week and month of the year can help me identify patterns in bike usage and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4.  Finally, I plan to analyze the duration of the trips for each starting point and time. This information can help me understand how long riders typically use the bikes for and whether there are any patterns or trends in trip duration based on the starting location or time. Overall, I am looking forward to exploring this dataset and gaining insights into the usage patterns of the Ford GoBike system."
