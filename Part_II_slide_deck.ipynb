    "The Ford GoBike dataset contains anonymized trip data for the bike-sharing system from June 2017 to April 2019. **However, I decided to only use the data in the year 2018 (January 2018 to December 2018).** The data includes information on individual bike rides such as trip duration, start and end time, start and end station, bike ID, and user type. Additionally, demographic data such as age, gender, and membership type is provided for some users.\n",

    "I manually downloaded the datasets from the [System Data | Bay Wheels | Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data) page. The datasets were in the form of a zip file. I extracted the zip files and saved the csv files in the `data` folder as this notebook. The zip files are in `data/zip_files` folder."
